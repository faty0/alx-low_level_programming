This is a new project in ALX program
We are still embarking in the journey of low level programmimg
Today's project is about singly linked list in C
which is a data structure's type that is linear
and dymanic, while Arrays are linear and static
So, linked list seems to be intresting as they allow 
to dynamically allocate memory.
